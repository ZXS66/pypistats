This is a chromium extension to help you find downloads amount for specific python packages. For more info visit: https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/xxxx (to be updated)

It is rely on https://pypistats.org/, which query Google Cloud BigQuery to get the data.

Due to CORS restriction, this extension can only query the data from a proxy which enable CORS, thus you may [build your own proxy server](https://github.com/ZXS66/pypistats-proxy) if you want to use it, or you can use this extension for free (no ads) on Microsoft Edge. (personal use only, be nice.)
